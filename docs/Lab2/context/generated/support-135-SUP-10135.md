# Support Ticket SUP-10135 - Permissions/Auditability

**Product:** Worklane
**Customer industry:** Education
**Company size:** 1,000â€“5,000
**Category:** permissions / audit

## Customer message (summarized)
- Need exportable audit logs for quarterly security review.
- They specifically referenced a recent change on: Project
- Asked for: Admin role (manage members + settings); also mentioned: Admin role (manage members + settings)
- Audit expectation: retention 90 days; export preference: API access later

## Workaround today
- Restrict access by keeping only a few owners and exporting PDFs weekly.
- Use spreadsheets for broad visibility; copy/paste changes into Worklane.

## Notes
Customer context: FinTech org, ~50â€“200 employees, evaluating Worklane for intake + roadmapping. Issue: Need per-workspace roles; some workspaces contain sensitive initiatives. Example: A Request was updated and the team asked for proof of actor, timestamp, and previous value. Requested capability: Separate permission to view audit logs. Also asked about retention (90 days) and API access later. Impact: blocked rollout to stakeholders; security review raised concerns; internal admin overhead increased.

Customer context: Manufacturing org, ~500â€“1,000 employees, evaluating Worklane for intake + roadmapping. Issue: Need read-only stakeholders; execs keep accidentally editing. Example: A Project was updated and the team asked for proof of actor, timestamp, and previous value. Requested capability: Editor role (edit roadmap + requests only). Also asked about retention (30 days) and CSV export. Impact: blocked rollout to stakeholders; security review raised concerns; internal admin overhead increased.

Customer context: SaaS org, ~200â€“500 employees, evaluating Worklane for intake + roadmapping. Issue: Need to limit editing to a subset of users; contractors should not edit. Example: A Integration setting was deleted and the team asked for proof of actor, timestamp, and previous value. Requested capability: Editor role (edit roadmap + requests only). Also asked about retention (1 year) and downloadable JSON. Impact: blocked rollout to stakeholders; security review raised concerns; internal admin overhead increased.

## Severity
- Business impact: deal risk / security review / exec visibility
